## What is the purpose of UX storytelling?

The purpose of UX storytelling is so that designers can get inside the head of their user's and create a product that understands their needs. By generating vivid personas, backstories, use cases, etc., designers are able to find insights in potential user thoughts behavior, contexts, and more in order to create a product fitting for that range of people. Not only that, but UX storytelling allows for a team of designers to be on the same page when it comes to creating a cohesive product, as they share an understanding of who they are creating solutions for and why.
