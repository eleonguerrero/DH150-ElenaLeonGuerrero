# Mental Maintenance: Helping Happiness in Middle-Aged Women

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation
Elena Leon Guerrero - DH 150 Fall 2020

Project Description:
After being tasked with a project that aimed to improve the well-being, or happiness, of the middle-aged women, I contemplated what exactly improves one's well-being. As a Psychology major, my first thought was anything and everything to do with mental health, and as someone living through a pandemic, I've realized how important it is to check in with one's emotions and thoughts throughout the days. Luckily, this mental maintenance of acknowledging and interacting with one's thoughts and emotions is actually a way to improve well-being, especially when facilitated by acts such as journaling. Journaling allows people to manage stress and anxiety, provide an outlet to evaluate and release feelings, and even track moods or symptoms on a day-to-day basis such that patterns can be learned and (hopefully) controlled. After searching the app store to find apps with features such as mood tracking and journaling, I often felt a bit overwhelmed in what exactly I would use to manage my emotions as many of them supplied a lot of other features aimed at other ways to improve my mental health that I didn't necessarily want (e.g. meditation recordings). Not only that, but some of the apps were either dated, buggy, or not-user friendly. As a result, I intend to focus my project on user-friendly app that would streamline the processes of mood tracking and journaling to allow users to manage their emotions without having to feel overwhelmed about the process. 

### Usability Issue Severity Ratings
The scale below is used to rate the severity of usability problems found in the interfaces being evaluated:
| Rating  | Significance                                                                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project |
| 2       | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority                  |
| 3       | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority        |
