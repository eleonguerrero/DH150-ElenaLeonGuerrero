# Assignment 7: High-Fidelity Prototype

## Elena Leon Guerrero - DH150 Fall 2020

## Overview

### Project Description

My project aims to help foster good mental health in the target demographic of middle-aged women through journaling, specifically, addressing the current issues I’ve seen with digital journaling. Journaling is a proven way to bolster one’s mental health, offering benefits such as an outlet for stress, anxiety relief, and tracking one's mental state. In this project, I intend to address problems that make the digital journaling process less streamlined and personalized, such as by doing away with unnecessary features, while adding customization ones.

### Prototype Purpose

The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is to try to  fully flesh out the UX/UI design of my project in order to properly visualize the functionality, accessibility, and overall aesthetics of the app. By creating this high-fidelity prototype, I will have a way for users to easily test the flow of my project, obtain feedback about the overall design, and make future iterations.

### Prototyping Process 
This high-fidelity prototype was created following several steps of the design process. Following a heuristic evaluation of existing journaling apps, usability testing, and user contextual analysis, I created 3 personas, for whom a product like this is intended for, and their accompanying tasks. After that, I created a hand-drawn low-fidelity prototype that was tested by a user. Taking from each step of the process, and most recently the feedback from my low-fidelity prototype, I implemented these features and changes into designing my high-fidelity prototype created in Figma.


## Tasks

The tasks capable in this prototype are as follows: 

* *Task 1: Mood documentation and journal entry creation.*
* *Task 2: Addition of a new entry later in the day.*
* *Task 3: Edit of an entry.*
* *Task 4: Addition of aesthetic and personalization features (e.g. photo sharing) to make journaling more customizable, engaging, and fulfilling.*

## Key Feedback from Initial Impression Test

Upon showing my high-fidelity prototype to a user, these were the main pieces of feedback they had to say:

* *“I like it, I think the design is clean!*
* *“The colors are nice, but not too in your face, which is something you’d want for something where you’re writing your daily thoughts -- something not overbearing.”*
* *The UI is intuitive, it doesn’t confuse me, and seems pretty straightforward.”*
