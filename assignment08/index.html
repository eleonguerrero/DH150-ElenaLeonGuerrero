 <h3 style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>Introduction</h3>
      
<p style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>This quarter, we were tasked with coming up with a product that improved the well-being and happiness of middle aged women. As a psychology major, I wanted to focus on the aspect of mental health, and ways to maintain and foster positive mental health. I believe that monitoring one's emotions and thoughts is important to improving well-being, and after thinking of things that can help improve mental health in the technological sphere, I stumbled upon journaling and mood-tracking apps. Journaling is a proven way to bolster happiness, as it can be used for an outlet to manage stress and anxiety, and a way to see patterns in one's mental health. In addition, digitized journaling and mood tracking in particular provides some additional benefits to its physical counterpart, such as the potential for efficiency and ease, lack of physical materials, and more.</p><br>

<h3 style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>Design Statement</h3>
<p style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>Upon my initial research of mood tracking and journaling apps, I found a few key problems. The first was that I often felt overwhelmed with the multitude of extraneous features provided in an app that was supposed to be about journaling, such as meditative mantras or yoga. Not only that, but many apps seemed dated, buggy, and not exactly user-friendly in terms or mindful of my time due to all the extra features. Additionally, I felt as though I couldn't really customize or personalize my entries the way I wanted, such as by adding supplemental information like pictures that would make my thoughts and memories more fulfilling to write about.</p><br>

<p style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>These are key problems as older users may abandon apps that could actually help them if they aren't straightforward. Furthermore, adults are busy, and sometimes don't have the minutes to spare on extra features they didn't ask for in the first place. Finally, with the addition of personalization, users can get a holistic and more fulfilling record of their thoughts, memories, and everyday lives as they journal. As a result, this project aimed to resolve those issues by creating a user-friendly app that was streamlined. I wanted to create an project that skipped all the extra features to get users through the core use, journaling and mood tracking, as quickly or slowly as they needed, with all the special touches they wanted to feel fulfilled in their mental health outlet.</p><br>

<h3 style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation </h3><br>

   <p style='margin-top:50px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>To start the process of creating this project, I first started with analyzing similar apps through a heuristic evaluation. The two apps were Moodfit and Moodnotes, pictured above to the left and right, respectively. Through this evaluation, some of the biggest issues I found were dated and buggy interfaces, lack of error prevention and user control and freedom, and some consistency/accessibilty issues within the designs. Additionally, these apps had a lot of excessive features (e.g. meditation), or features that did not work well (e.g. facial recognition scan to track a mood) whereas some features could not even be located (e.g. Moodnotes' help page). </p><br> 
    <p style='margin-top:0px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>As a result of this heuristic evaluation, I wanted to work on a few key aspects when creating my project, namely: an modern and accessible interface, providing users with a better sense of control, and doing away with excessive features in the app.</p><br>

    </div>
<p style='margin-top:50px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'> Following my heuristic evaluation, I then conducted a usability test using one of the competitor apps, Moodnotes, to try to get insight on what to implement in order to improve the usability of my project. From this evaluation it seemed that an app like Moodnotes could be navigated fairly easily to complete certain tasks, contrary to my initial beliefs about the app. </p>
 <p style='margin-top:0px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>Despite the contradictions to my thoughts on the Moodnotes app, the usability test proved to be a very valuable learning experience.</p><br>

    </div>
    <p style='margin-top:50px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>After completing competitor analyses, it was time to get to work on understanding my users to make my project the most fulfilling it could be. This was done through user research via contextual inquiry. I asked a friend of mine who was similar to the target demographic I had in mind  to do an interview with me so that I could get her thoughts on journaling, reasons why and contexts in which she does it, and observe the way she journals in-app and on paper. </p><br>
    <p style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>From my interview with my user, I found interesting insights into when users do journal, what differences there are between journaling traditionally and digitally, pros and cons between the two, and what would make a journaling app fun, creative, and engaging.</p><br>

<h3 style='margin-top:50px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>UX Storytelling: Personas, Journey Maps, & Scenarios</h3><br>

    </div>
    
    <p style='margin-top:50px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>After receiving a bit of insight into journaling through contextualizing the activity with a user, I came up with a few key features I wanted my design to have. I wanted mood documentation that was tracked in an accurate and user-friendly way, to provide users a way to document their mood throughout the day or edit their entries to their liking, and to allow for optional aesthetic features to make digital journaling an even better creative outlet and stress relieving process. </p><br>
    <p style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>To do this, I created 3 personas and accompanying scenarios and empathy maps with which to keep in mind when designing for the aforementioned tasks. These personas encapsulated a variety of backgrounds, goals, motivations, and needs that I had to keep in mind in order to have empathy and design from my potentual users' perspective.</p><br>

    </div><br>
    
    <p style='margin-top:50px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>Before I could create a full-fledged product, I needed to brainstorm ideas first. As such, I created sketches of various screens layouts that would give me a sense of the design and overall flow of the app via a low-fidelity prototype. The prototype encompassed four main goals: mood documentation and journal entry creation, addition of a new entry throughout the day, editing an entry, and addition of aesthetic/personalization features (i.e. pictures). This prototype was then tested with a user to see how the well my ideas and app flow translated.</p><br>

    </div><br>
    
    <p style='margin-top:50px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>Using Figma, I brought my low fidelity wireframe to life by creating a high-fidelity prototype of my app. Each of the four tasks outlined above can also be found in this prototype as well. Furthermore, by conducting a cognitive walkthrough with a few peers, I was able to get important feedback from fellow designers into what I should change about my high fidelity prototype to create the final design. Suggestions included adding new screens where the next move was ambiguous, clearer "Next" buttons, and more.</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:50px;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'>Reflection & Conclusion: What You Learned Throughout the Process</h3><br>
<p style='margin-top:0;margin-left:200px;margin-right:200px;'> Overall, the process of creating an product from ground-zero was a really enlightening experience. It was very rewarding to see something that started out as a simple iteration on current apps turn into something tangible that I made with my own ideas and hands. The entire process was also great practice to see what the design process is really like, as well as get some practice with industry-standard design programs. Finally, I think the process of creating this project made me aware of what it's like to be a designer, but even moreso what it's like to be a designer from a user's perspective -- I think I have reached a far greater understanding of just how important it is to take users into account of any project every step of the way. </p><br>
