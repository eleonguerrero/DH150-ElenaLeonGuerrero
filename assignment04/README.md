# Assignment 4: Users in Context

## Elena Leon Guerrero - DH150 Fall 2020

## Step01: Specify the main design challenge

### What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?

The main activity that this project would support would be to provide users a way to both track their mood and create journal entries quickly, effectively, and to the most fulfilling extent. Journaling is important as it provides an emotional outlet for people, allows for the monitoring of mental health, and even helps to relieve stress through writing, and sometimes even creativity/art (e.g. aspects of bullet journaling). However, from past interviews, conducting this process through an app was found to be boring, one-note, or at least not as engaging as a user had hoped. As such, this project aims to serve users by increasing their motivation to and engagement with journaling in order to monitor, support, and foster good mental health by taking the benefits of journaling on paper to a digitized sphere.

### What is the basic need involved for that activity?

The basic need involved for this activity is in regards to safety needs, specifically emotional security. Because emotional security is involved, needs regarding health and well-being are also related.

### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

The traditional and current solutions to satisfying these needs are far reaching, but in regards to this activity, specific types of journaling, such as bullet journaling, help with the mood tracking aspect of this project. Bullet journaling also encompasses a lot of activities into one, such as planning, creating to-do lists, acting as a creative outlet, and the aforementioned tracking of mental health through journal entries that encapsulate daily activities and feelings. Traditional journaling, without all the other aspects of bullet journaling, helps the mental health cause as well, where people write down their moods, feelings, and activities in a physical journal manually as well. However, current solutions also include existing apps that serve journaling purposes as well.

### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

The limitations that could be improved with digital technology are as follows. First, a user would not have to carry around a physical journal, nor the accompanying materials (e.g. writing or crafting media) needed to use the journal -- they would simply need their phone. Additionally, the lack of having to keep track of another personal item means that it is one less thing to misplace. Finally, logs of journal entries are easy to back up for safeguarding, as well as hard to lose in a data sense too.

## Step02: Target users

### What are the characteristics of users?
The characteristics of the users would be as follows:

* Demographics: Female, late teen to middle aged, with access to a cellular device.
* Preferences Enjoy creativity and personal growth/insights, cares about mental health, and are perhaps inclined to processes such as journaling or other creative outlets as a form of stress-relief from a busy or overwhelming life.
* Experties: Relatively familiar and comfortable with basic technological skills, but no real expertise is required. 

### Where would the users do that activity? 
Users could complete this activity basically anywhere. However, the activity is likely to be in their house, while winding down for the night or while taking the time to practice self-care or check-in mentally. Many people can journal, traditionally or in-app, on-the-go whenever there is downtime, however.

### What would the users do to complete that activity?
To complete this activity, most users would either manually log their mood in a journal (e.g. a mood tracking page in their bullet journal), or create a full-fledged journal entry in a physical journal. A mobile app may also be used.


## Step 03: Pick Research Methods

### Method 1: Interview
The first research method I chose to use was a traditional interview style. I asked my interviewee a multitude of questions regarding various topics about journaling traditionally and using an app.

### Method 2: Participatory Observaton
The second research method I chose to use was participatory observation in order to get a sense of how a user would journal in the online and offline settings, their differences, and their strengths. I had my interviewee complete two tasks: journal traditionally, and track their mood/journal using an app.

To conduct the interview, I met with my interviewee over Zoom, around the time their nightly journal session would occur. The participant sat where they were most comfortable and conducted the activities there. The interview was recorded through Zoom, with the app screen-mirrored on the participant's screen. The participant would periodically show me what they were working on as they spoke allowed when physically journaling.

### Interesting Insights

1.) When users tend to journal (2:54)
* *"...Usually, I journal because I'm in a certain mood, like if I feeling angry, frustrated, but excited, then that like sparks my journaling, and like go from there. And I talk about, like what things that happen that lead to those emotions."* 


2.) The inherent differences between journaling traditionallly vs. digitally (3:29)
* *"I think sometimes if it's like really late at night, then I'll do it on my phone in like a Notes app, because I can get like my thoughts down faster when I type, because I type faster than I write. I think my thoughts are more complete when it was on my phone. But I spend more time when it's on a notebook because I have time to think through my thoughts."*


3.) Journaling via an app can make a user more accountable (35:25)
* *"I think being consistent is one difficult part because I like only pick up my pen and paper, like if I'm feeling like a really like heightened emotion, like really happy, or like, really sad, but I feel like the app would keep me more accountable of just like everyday motions, and like tracking how I feel every day. So it's like more of a trend of like emotions versus like- so you can see progress, versus just like seeing like such high-highs and low-lows in a notebook."* 

4.) How to make a journaling app fun, creative, personalized, and engaging (46:03)
* *"Um, I think maybe- I used this app before where you could like insert pictures. Or like, you could even use like emojis maybe, to like describe how- or like insert emojis into like while you’re typing ‘cuz I like to draw a lot of happy faces or sad faces when I journal. I like how it’s timed stamped. But, I think pictures would be really cool."*


## Reflection
Overall, I enjoyed the contextual inquiry assignment. I felt that this process felt more fluid and natural than the pilot UT conducted prior, and I felt like I had more freedom to ask questions and make observations, especially as the user didn't have such specific tasks. I think from these extra questions I was able to ask off-script also allowed me to gain valuable insights I would have otherwise missed out on in a more rigid interview, and I even saw that my participant was confirming some of my hypotheses for new features for a journaling app since I could branch out a lot more, and because she was much closer to the target persona than my last user. I think one thing I would do differently next time would be the fact that I might have guided her along with a few questions, or she seemed unclear with a few of my verbal responses, so I would try to mitigate those.
